 There was a person who was in his own field.
 He was picking the fruits of a tree, which were probably guavas or something. I don't know.
 As he went picking (the fruits), there came a young person who went to carry the tree fruits.
 Then, (he) rode a bike, taking a basket of fruits, which were probably guavas. I don't know.
 It's like he ran taking those fruits.
 There was a stone on his way, and he bumped into it.
 There was a stone on the road. As he went past, he bumped into it and fell. All those guavas that he carried rolled down.
 Then, there came three boys, who seemed rather young.
 They went to help lift up his bike and pick up the guavas, refilling the basket.
 Then, they went away, and separated (with the boy).
 Those kids went passed the road and saw something used for covering the head, which was kind of like a hat.
 The hat was made of something like grass. It seemed to be a leaf hat.
 As they saw it (that hat), they called out, making noises and whistling with their mouths, to the person who had already gone riding the bicycle with the fruits.
 (He) looked back, and they they went to return the thing for covering his hat, that leaf hat.
 That's all. They separated.
 I finished.
